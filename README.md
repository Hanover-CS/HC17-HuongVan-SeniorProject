Hoang Van Senior Project Proposal

This is my senior thesis. I want to build a speech-driven robot using Arduino BOE shield Bot, and EasyVR 3.0 Speech Recognition Shield based on Hidden Markov Model, which is widely used in speech recognition field.

Goals of this project are to be able to direct movement of the robot using speech and to design a series of experiments to test this speech-driven robotic system
